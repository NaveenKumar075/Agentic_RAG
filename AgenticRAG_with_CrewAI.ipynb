      "The input query consists of two separate questions: \"What is quantum computing?\" and \"What is the command for git rebase?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "For the first question, \"What is quantum computing?\", the query is already well-formed and clear. However, to improve search effectiveness, we can add relevant keywords. A rewritten query could be: \"Introduction to quantum computing basics\" or \"Quantum computing definition and principles\". \n",
      "\n",
      "For the second question, \"What is the command for git rebase?\", the query is also clear but can be improved by adding more specific keywords. A rewritten query could be: \"Git rebase command syntax\" or \"How to use git rebase command in Git version control\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the original queries are already quite specific, we can also consider keeping them as is, as they already convey the intended meaning. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, considering the goal of improving search effectiveness, the rewritten queries are: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. \"Introduction to quantum computing basics\" \n",
      "2. \"Git rebase command syntax\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These rewritten queries maintain the original intent while being optimized for search. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we must provide a single final answer that combines both queries, it could be: \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Introduction to quantum computing basics and Git rebase command syntax\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But since the original instruction is to return the actual complete content as the final answer and the queries are separate, the final answer should be the two separate rewritten queries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the final answer is: \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Introduction to quantum computing basics\" and \"Git rebase command syntax\" \n",

      "However, to exactly follow the format and provide a single final answer, we can combine them into a single query: \n",

      "But to keep the original intent and provide the most complete answer, we should provide both queries as separate entities. \n",
